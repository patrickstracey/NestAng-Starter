# NestJs Back-end API

I have followed the documentation and tried to stick to best practices for file location and directory structure:

- Services live in the directory with their related controller, module, and needed DTOs
- Any API route is stored within the top level `routes` directory so that other directories that are not controllers do
  not get lost in a long file tree list
- the `database` directory contains everything needed to get mongo initialized, but keep in mind the initialization is
  called in the top level `main.ts` file.
- Utility items like route decorators and route guards are stored within the top level `utility` directory.
- Future items like a mail or upload service are likely to be stored in a top-level directory called `mail`
  and `uploads` respectively.

The project uses some npm libraries that NestJS does not include on new project creation, things like `@nest/jwt`
and `passport` are used for authentication and if you ultimately don't want or need these items you are free to remove
them once you have put in your own preferred providers.
